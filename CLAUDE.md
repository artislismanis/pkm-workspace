# CLAUDE.md — PKM Workspace

## Environment

- **Docker Compose container** (Ubuntu 24.04) providing: Node 22 LTS (nvm), Python 3.12 (uv), Claude Code CLI, ttyd web terminal, tmux, ripgrep, fd, git-delta, atuin, fzf, jq, gh
- **ttyd** serves a web terminal on port 7681; the obsidian-claude-sandbox plugin connects via HTTP/WebSocket
- Vault bind-mounted from host at `/workspace/vault/` (configured via `PKM_VAULT_PATH` in `.env`)
- Changes to vault files are **immediately reflected on the host filesystem**

## Key Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/workspace/` | Repository root (tooling and configuration) |
| `/workspace/vault/` | The Obsidian vault (bind-mounted from host) |
| `/workspace/Dockerfile` | Container image definition |
| `/workspace/docker-compose.yml` | Service configuration |
| `/workspace/scripts/` | Verification and firewall scripts |
| `/workspace/.claude/` | Claude Code project settings |

## Safety Constraints

- **Never delete** vault files without explicit user confirmation
- **Never modify** plugin binaries or vault config directories unless specifically asked
- **Prefer non-destructive operations**: create new files or append to existing rather than overwriting
- **Bulk operations**: always describe the scope and show a sample (3–5 files) before executing

## Vault-Specific Instructions

Each vault carries its own `CLAUDE.md` with methodology, folder structure, tag taxonomy, link conventions, templates, and content workflows. See `vault/CLAUDE.md` for this vault's inner workings.
